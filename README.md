# Comfy UI FatLabels

This is my first foray into making any sort of custom node for Comfy UI. As well as my first time putting anything on Github.

Install in the 'custom_nodes' folder in your Comfy UI install.

It's a super simple custom node for Comfy UI, to generate text, with a font size option. 

Useful for bigger labelling of nodes, helpful for wider screen captures or tutorials. Plus you can of course use the text within your generations.

Simply search for Fat or Labels, or yes... that's right  FatLabels node, once it's installed. Write your text, choose a font size, link up an image preview or save image node and press generate.

If I get time, I'll explore adding extra font option, colours etc.

We'll see.
